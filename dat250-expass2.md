# Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

### Technical problems
The installations went smoothly and I have worked with JPA before via DAT108, so I was quite comfortable. The only problem was that I struggled to see what was inside of the derby database when the tests did not pass. I ended up simply deleting the DB folder for each run so that I only had the fresh data inside of the database.

### Inspected the DB
I edited the persistence.xml file to produce the SQL script for creating the schema. I inspected the script to see if it matched the domain model.
